# A05: Family Tree generation using Graphviz.

## Sai Neeraj Chandragiri

### Description:
Create a dot file using python. Used a CSV file to read the family data. The dot file generated will help in generating the family tree. Also, divided the the family on clan bases.

### Files

|   #   | File |  Description |
| :---: | ----------- | ---------------------- |
|    01  |  [family_data.csv](https://github.com/SaiNeeraj2503/4883-SoftwareTools-Neeraj/blob/main/Assignments/A05/data.csv)| CSV input data|  
|    02  |  [family_tree.dot](https://github.com/SaiNeeraj2503/4883-SoftwareTools-Neeraj/blob/main/Assignments/A05/family_tree.dot)|dot file generated from pyhton code| 
|    03 |  [family_tree.png](https://github.com/SaiNeeraj2503/4883-SoftwareTools-Neeraj/blob/main/Assignments/A05/graphviz.png)| Output of grahviz code| 
|    04 |  [main.py](https://github.com/SaiNeeraj2503/4883-SoftwareTools-Neeraj/blob/main/Assignments/A05/main.py)| python file to create dot file| 



### Design Patterns:
The differentation of gender is based on the font color used.
All the Female have Red Font and All the Female have black Font.
Record shape is given to all the nodes.
The child is given blue and the spouse a green font.


### Requirements:
1. Python
2. Graphviz

### Usage: 
In the first step created the csv random data. After generating the file, created a python script which will help in generating the dot. copied the dot file code and used graphviz to visualise the family tree.
